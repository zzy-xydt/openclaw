summary: "Plugin SDK subpath catalog: which imports live where, grouped by area"
read_when:
  - Choosing the right plugin-sdk subpath for a plugin import
  - Auditing bundled-plugin subpaths and helper surfaces
title: "Plugin SDK subpaths"
---

The plugin SDK contains narrow public subpaths and repository-only bundled
helpers under `openclaw/plugin-sdk/`. This page catalogs both and labels
private-local entries explicitly. Three files define the boundary:

- `scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-entrypoints.json`: the maintained entrypoint inventory
  the build compiles.
- `scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-private-local-only-subpaths.json`: internal subpaths
  excluded from the typed, documented SDK. Production entries remain available
  as JavaScript-only host runtime exports for separately published official
  plugins; test-only entries stay unexported.
- `src/plugin-sdk/entrypoints.ts`: classification metadata for deprecated
  subpaths, reserved bundled helpers, supported bundled facades, and
  plugin-owned public surfaces.

Maintainers audit the public export count with `pnpm plugin-sdk:surface` and
active reserved helper subpaths with `pnpm plugins:boundary-report:summary`;
unused reserved helper exports fail the CI report instead of staying in the
public SDK as dormant compatibility debt.

For the plugin authoring guide, see [Plugin SDK overview](/plugins/sdk-overview).

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plugin-sdk/plugin-entry`      | `definePluginEntry`                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `plugin-sdk/core`              | `defineChannelPluginEntry`, `createChatChannelPlugin`, `createChannelPluginBase`, `defineSetupPluginEntry`, `buildChannelConfigSchema`, `buildJsonChannelConfigSchema`, `resolveTailscalePublishedHost` |
| `plugin-sdk/provider-entry`    | Private-local after July 2026; `defineSingleProviderPluginEntry`                                                                                                                                        |
| `plugin-sdk/migration`         | Private-local after July 2026; Migration provider item helpers such as `createMigrationItem`, reason constants, item status markers, redaction helpers, and `summarizeMigrationItems`                   |
| `plugin-sdk/migration-runtime` | Private-local after July 2026; Runtime migration helpers such as `copyMigrationFileItem`, `resolvePlannedMigrationTargets`, `withCachedMigrationConfigRuntime`, and `writeMigrationReport`              |
| `plugin-sdk/health`            | Doctor health-check registration, detection, repair, selection, severity, and finding types for bundled health consumers                                                                                |

### Compatibility and private-local helpers

Only the later-window deprecated subpaths remain exported. July 2026 aliases and
unused subpaths were deleted, while bundled-only helpers were removed from the
public package and are labeled private-local below. The maintained list is
`scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-deprecated-public-subpaths.json`; CI rejects bundled
`plugin-sdk/text-runtime` are compatibility only, and `plugin-sdk/zod` is a
compatibility re-export: import `zod` directly from `zod`. The broad domain
barrels `plugin-sdk/agent-runtime`, `plugin-sdk/channel-lifecycle`,
`plugin-sdk/conversation-runtime`, `plugin-sdk/hook-runtime`,
`plugin-sdk/media-runtime`, `plugin-sdk/plugin-runtime`, and
`plugin-sdk/security-runtime` are likewise deprecated in favor of focused
subpaths.

OpenClaw's Vitest-backed test-helper subpaths are repo-local only and are no
longer package exports: `agent-runtime-test-contracts`,
`channel-contract-testing`, `channel-target-testing`, `channel-test-helpers`,
`plugin-state-test-runtime`, `plugin-test-api`, `plugin-test-contracts`,
`plugin-test-runtime`, `provider-http-test-mocks`, `provider-test-contracts`,
`reply-payload-testing`, `sqlite-runtime-testing`, `test-env`, `test-fixtures`,
`test-live`, `test-live-auth`, `test-media-generation`,
`test-media-understanding`, `test-node-mocks`, and `testing`. The private bundled helper surface
`ssrf-runtime-internal` is also repo-local only.

### Bundled plugin helper subpaths

Bundled-only helper modules are private-local after the July 2026 sweep. Cross-owner imports are blocked by package contract guardrails. `src/plugin-sdk/entrypoints.ts` separately tracks the supported bundled facades that remain public, SDK
entrypoints backed by their bundled plugin until generic contracts replace
`plugin-sdk/qa-runner-runtime`, `plugin-sdk/telegram-account`,
deprecated for new code; see the per-row notes below.

  </Accordion>

Later-window channel compatibility subpaths remain public only through their
registry dates. July aliases such as direct-DM access, reply-options, pairing
paths, and channel runtime splinters have been removed; bundled-only helpers
are private-local.

Provider usage snapshots normally report one or more quota `windows`, each with
a label, percent used, and optional reset time. Providers that expose balance or
account-state text instead of resettable quota windows should return
`summary` with an empty `windows` array rather than fabricating percentages.
OpenClaw displays that summary text in status output; use `error` only when the
usage endpoint failed or returned no usable usage data.

  </Accordion>

Use `isLoopbackHost(host)` when a plugin must accept only the local machine. It accepts `localhost`, IPv4 loopback literals across `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, bracketed IPv6, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback literals. It parses IP literals rather than matching text prefixes, so a DNS name such as `127.0.0.1.evil.com` is not loopback. Use `isPrivateOrLoopbackHost(host)` only when private-network hosts such as RFC 1918 addresses are also valid.

  <Accordion title="Reserved bundled-helper subpaths">
    Reserved bundled-helper SDK subpaths are narrow owner-specific surfaces for
    bundled plugin code. They are tracked in the SDK inventory so package
    builds and aliasing stay deterministic, but they are not general plugin
    authoring APIs. New reusable host contracts should use generic SDK subpaths
    such as `plugin-sdk/gateway-runtime` and `plugin-sdk/ssrf-runtime`.

    | Subpath | Owner and purpose |
    | --- | --- |
    | `plugin-sdk/codex-mcp-projection` | Private-local after July 2026; Bundled Codex plugin helper for projecting user MCP server config into Codex app-server thread config (reserved package export) |
    | `plugin-sdk/codex-session-transcript-runtime` | Private-local bundled Codex plugin helper for serializing transcript-mirror writes (reserved package export) |
